This program is an attempt to control cameras via the USB Host library available for Android 3.1 and above. Base of the code is taken from David Brownell's Java USB Camera Tools aka JPhoto from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jphoto/ .
 
The idea is to create a tool similar to gPhoto for the Android device. At the moment, certain models of Canon EOS and Nikon DSLR Cameras are working.
